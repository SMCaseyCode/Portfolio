# Portfolio
This is an up to date website of my current skills and noteable projects. This site in itself is a way of challenging myself to learn some front-end technologies and techniques.

Things that could still be improved:
- Responsive font size. Currently, text does not scale to resolution well and will look off on 4K resolution screens
- Better background image using a higher resolution portrait.
- Card scaling on projects section can often look too large on some screens
- Design. Could be more exciting.
- Animations. Looking forward to adding these.
